# Tutoring_Website

## To run the website:
You must download the API as well as the frontend, and configure the .env file in the API.

### .env configuration:
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=<<ADD A LINK TO A MONGODB SERVER (SUCH AS ATLAS)>>  
PORT=4000  
EMAIL_FROM=MEMO.UCC.TUTORING.PP@gmail.com  
EMAIL_FROM_PASSWORD=TutoringSMTP123  
EMAIL_FROM_HOST=smtp.gmail.com  
EMAIL_FROM_PORT=587  

You can change these settings as you wish, but I cannot guarantee that it will work if changed.

### Installing Node Modules:
Open API and APP 2. In each of these files, run the command:

$ npm install

You must have NodeJS for this. Install here: https://nodejs.org/en/
